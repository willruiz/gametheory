Variables I need to draw:

branch indexes (top and bot)
p2_choices (top and bot)
p1_switch

Draw out two canvas that illustrate seperating equilibrium

Next step:
Pooling 
Create "save as" entry function
Improve class structure of SGE

What components do I have?

Possible subclasses 
1. tkinter GUI functions
- Draws lines
- Takes in user entries
- Stores them into matrix
2. Numpy external file matrix handlers
- Handles matrix and loads/saves them to outside .npy files
3. Signal game logic code
- Handles matrix and runs payoff logic
